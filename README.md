# COMP367 Lab 3 â€“ Agile Process in Azure DevOps

This repository is for **COMP367 Lab 3**, where I have implemented an **Agile Process in Azure DevOps**.  

## Repository Details
- **Project Name:** MVC Agile Process  
- **Lab Task:** Set up Agile process using Epics, Features, User Stories, and Tasks in Azure DevOps  
- **Iterations:** 
  - Iteration 1: Create MVC Application  
  - Iteration 2: Add Search and Validation  

## Azure DevOps Setup
All Agile work items, including Epics, Features, and Sprints, are created in **Azure DevOps**.  
GitHub is being used to link the repository to the project.

## Note
